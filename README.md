# Toolbox

**An assorted miscellany of tools and toys.**

- Matrixfile - Easily creates and manages files of CSV data (you may use tabs or other delimiters as you wish).
- QuantumTextFile - Readies a text output file but does not actually create it until and unless the first write operation takes place.
- StatusCodeDescription - Useful for matching HTTP Status Code values to anappropriate text description, as well as determining if the code if passing or valid.
- SubnameFactory - Do you need to programmatically generate several similar names? TestA, TestB, TestC and so on? This makes it easy.
- ZipFileCreator - ...is exactly that. It creates a compressed Zip file containing all files in the directory you specify, recursing down any subdirectories it finds.

- **ToolboxJava** can be found here (TBD) This is a wrapper for Toolbox that allows use as if it were native Java avoiding the usual issues of using compiled Kotlin directly in a Java program.

## Usage & Known Issues
- Clone the repository and open the root directory in IntelliJ IDEA CE.
- The Kotlin code and the overall project is intended for use with IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition). Eclipse is supported for using the Java wrappers. Feel free to adapt the code to any other IDE or Editor you're comfortable with, with the understanding that I don't officially support such use.
- All projects are "Kotlin First". Use from Java is supported by way of the Java wrappers, and only using the Kotlin bits when a Java wrapping is not available.
